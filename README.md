Just arrived on earth last sunday. It will take another week to recharge my spaceship to leave earth. I hope my predicament is not perinnial. This tranistory visit on earth might change my view. This sudden loss of fuel has derailed my plans. Now i will reach home after some detour. This is very hostile planet for aliens. I should make my move assidously.

Such a frugal life.
